# z-drawer

A bottom drawer (vaul-style) on the native `<dialog>` foundation: rounded top, a
grab handle, and drag-to-dismiss. Shares [z-dialog](z-dialog.md)'s chrome and
modal behaviour — pull the handle down past a threshold to close, or release
short to snap back.

```html
<z-drawer heading="Quick actions">
  <z-button slot="trigger">Open drawer</z-button>

  <z-stack gap="sm">
    <z-button kind="ghost">Share</z-button>
    <z-button kind="ghost">Duplicate</z-button>
  </z-stack>
</z-drawer>
```
