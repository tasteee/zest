# z-toggle-group-item

A single item inside a [z-toggle-group](z-toggle-group.md). Carries a `value` and
a pressed state; it inherits accent/size/kind from the parent group but can
override any of them with its own variant flags.

```html
<z-toggle-group>
  <z-toggle-group-item value="bold" is-pressed>B</z-toggle-group-item>
  <z-toggle-group-item value="italic">I</z-toggle-group-item>
</z-toggle-group>
```
