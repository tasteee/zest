# z-terminal

A clean, chrome-styled terminal surface for command walkthroughs (install / CLI
usage docs). No line numbers or syntax highlighting — just a seamless Hyper-style
window with a mock shell + working directory, traffic-light dots, and per-line
copy on hover. Pass the source via the `code` **property**, one line per row.

Lines that start with the `prompt` marker (default `$`) are treated as commands:
they're copyable and copying strips the marker. Override which lines copy with
`copy-lines` (`all`, `none`, `commands`, or ranges like `1-3,5`).

```html
<z-terminal shell="zsh" cwd="~/app" code="$ npm install
added 42 packages"></z-terminal>
```

## Animated simulation

Add `animate` to play the content back like a live session: **command lines type
out** character-by-character with a blinking caret, **output lines fade in**
quickly, and reveals are staggered so only one line animates at a time.

```html
<z-terminal shell="zsh" cwd="~/app" animate start-on-view loop
  code="$ zesty build
$ zesty deploy"></z-terminal>
```

- `start-on-view` waits until the terminal scrolls into view before playing.
- `loop` auto-restarts `loop-delay` ms after the last line reveals.
- A **replay control** appears in the bottom-right once a run completes (suppress
  with `hide-replay`). It's available whether or not `loop` is set.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` skips the animation and renders the final state.

### Per-line timing (the `lines` property)

For control over how long each step holds, set the `lines` **property** to an
array instead of `code`. Each entry is a string (parsed like a `code` row) or an
object. `delay` is the pause **before** that line begins — so a slow step can
hold longer before the next one starts, instead of every gap being uniform.

```js
const term = document.querySelector('z-terminal')
term.animate = true
term.lines = [
  { text: '$ pnpm dev', typeSpeed: 55 },
  { text: 'compiling modules', delay: 900 },
  { text: '✓ ready in 842ms', delay: 700 },
]
```

Each object entry accepts: `text`, `type` (`command` | `output`, inferred from
the prompt marker when omitted), `delay`, `typeSpeed`, and `fade`.

### Controls

```js
term.play()     // start, or resume after pause
term.pause()    // freeze mid-sequence
term.restart()  // replay from the top
term.addEventListener('done', () => {})
```
