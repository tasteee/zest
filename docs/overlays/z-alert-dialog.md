# z-alert-dialog

A confirmation modal for destructive or consequential choices. Same native
`<dialog>` foundation as [z-dialog](z-dialog.md), but it owns its two actions
(cancel + confirm) and is intentionally **not** light-dismissable: clicking the
backdrop does nothing, and Esc resolves as an explicit cancel.

```html
<z-alert-dialog
  heading="Delete project?"
  description="This action cannot be undone."
  accent="error"
  confirm-label="Delete"
>
  <z-button slot="trigger" accent="error">Delete</z-button>
</z-alert-dialog>
```

```js
dialog.addEventListener('confirm', () => deleteProject())
dialog.addEventListener('cancel', () => {})
```
