//   unit     — happy-dom. Fast registration, mount and event-contract checks.
//              happy-dom has no ElementInternals, so anything about forms is
//              a no-op there and belongs in the browser project.
//   browser  — a real Chromium through Playwright. Form participation,
//              constraint validation, focus and anything else that needs the
//              platform rather than a simulation.
//
// `npm test` runs both. `npm run test:unit` / `npm run test:browser` pick one.

// Which Chromium drives the browser project. CI installs Playwright's own

// Edge is used instead, so a fresh clone needs no 200 MB download to run the
// suite. ZEST_BROWSER_CHANNEL=chromium|chrome|msedge overrides either.
